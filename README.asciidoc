= Asciidoctor Backends

This repository contains backends (i.e., templates) for https://github.com/erebor/asciidoctor[asciidoctor], a Ruby port of http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc].

The -dist suffix on a backend indicates it aims to be a replica of one of the backends distributed with AsciiDoc. Within those directories are folders for each templating engine, the default being Haml (haml).
